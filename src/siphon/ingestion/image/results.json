Speed is the silent killer of user experience. People don\u2019t want a slow agent, they want their answer now. Your users are impatient, and every millisecond of delay pushes them closer to abandonment.\n\n2. Latency compounds in multi-step agents. What starts as a 10-second task can balloon to 90 seconds when things go wrong. Each decision point, retry, and refinement step multiplies your latency problem. \n\n3. There are four key metrics to track: time to first token (TTFT), tokens per second (TPS), step latency, and end-to-end latency. Users start getting frustrated around 500ms to 1 second of TTFT.\n\n4. Streaming intermediate steps is a psychological hack that works wonders. Users don't actually need the response as quickly as possible, they just need to know something is happening. Show your work and they\u2019ll forgive the wait.\n\n5. Parallelism is your secret weapon. Why search for flights, then hotels, then activities sequentially when they don\u2019t depend on each other? Three 2-second operations in parallel takes 2 seconds total, not 6.\n\n6. The fastest inference is the one you don't have to do. Use caching mechanisms strategically. Both prefix caching at the API level and identical prompt caching can dramatically cut latency and costs.\n\n7. When you make your agent faster, you have two options: give all that time back to the user, or reinvest it into quality. Those 10 seconds you saved could power best-of-n sampling, self-consistency checks, or verification loops.\n\n8. Faster models unlock better experimentation. When you can run 14,000 evaluation questions in 30 seconds instead of hours, your iteration speed skyrockets and your confidence in small changes grows.\n\n9. Real-time intelligent co-pilots become possible when latency drops below human perception thresholds. Imagine AR glasses that can analyze what you\u2019re seeing and respond before you\u2019ve finished your thought.\n\n10. The best latency optimization strategy depends on your specific use case. E-commerce and customer support are extremely latency-sensitive, while users might tolerate longer waits for complex travel planning if the quality is worth it.\n\nSource: improvingrag.com", "llama4:16x17b": "The image presents a list of 10 key points related to optimizing latency in applications, with a focus on enhancing user experience.
