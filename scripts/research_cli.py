"""
Research CLI - Multi-document synthesis and analysis tool.

Performs focused research across a collection of documents by:
1. Extracting content relevant to a specific research question from each document
2. Synthesizing findings into a unified strategic analysis

Perfect for competitive intelligence, market research, or strategic analysis
where you have multiple sources (transcripts, articles, reports, etc.) and
need to understand what they collectively say about a specific topic.

Usage:
   research_cli.py "Company's AI strategy and competitive positioning"
   research_cli.py "Product roadmap priorities" --dir ./q3_meetings/
   research_cli.py "Market expansion plans" --pattern "*.md,*.pdf,*.txt"

The tool uses async processing for speed and provides structured output
suitable for strategic decision-making. Requires documents to be in
text-readable format (.md, .txt, or other plain text files).

TBD: have this use Siphon to arbitrarily convert multiple document formats; for the moment it's only .txt and .md files, so you need to manually create the set of resources.
NOTE: we exclude Python and Jinja2 files by default, as they are not relevant to the research synthesis. The jinja2 file is where we might define a more complex prompt template for the contextual focus.

Extract all content relevant to the following contextual focus:

<contextual_focus>
{{contextual_focus}}
</contextual_focus>

From the provided document, identify and extract:
1. Direct statements, quotes, or claims related to this topic
2. Supporting data, metrics, or evidence  
3. Strategic decisions, initiatives, or plans
4. Customer use cases, examples, or case studies
5. Competitive positioning or market analysis
6. Future roadmap items or announced developments

For each extracted item:
- Provide the specific text or paraphrase
- Note the source context (e.g., "CEO statement", "product demo", "Q2 earnings call")
- Indicate confidence level: Direct quote, Clear inference, or Implied from context

Group extractions by category and prioritize recent information and authoritative sources.

Exclude general company background, tangential mentions, and purely historical information unless strategically relevant.

If no relevant content is found, state "No relevant content identified."

Here's the document content:
<document_content>
{{document_content}}
</document_content>

Return ONLY your summary.

Based on the following extracted summaries from multiple sources, create a unified analysis of:
<contextual_focus>
{{contextual_focus}}
</contextual_focus>

EXTRACTED SUMMARIES:
<summaries>
{{summaries}}
</summaries>

Synthesize this information into a coherent summary that addresses:
- Key themes and strategic direction
- Supporting evidence and data points
- Notable contradictions or gaps between sources
- Actionable insights and implications

Structure your response with clear sections. Prioritize information from authoritative sources and recent developments. Where sources conflict or information is uncertain, note this explicitly.

Focus on providing a comprehensive yet concise understanding suitable for strategic decision-making.
